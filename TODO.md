# Even though this program is working fine in it's current state, I wanted to add in some Quality of Life features.

## 1) Adding functionality so that the counter is shown starting from loading the site

Currently, the site requires reloading once for the future sight counter to load the actual text. The first priority is to fix this so that the counter is available even without reloading the page.

## 2) Adjusting the height of the location of the counter

Even in the picture provided, the location of the counter is fairly low. This is to accomodate for other in-built counter such as rain, terrains and trick room.
Even though it affect anything, moving the counter up as much as possible would help make the counter look better.
